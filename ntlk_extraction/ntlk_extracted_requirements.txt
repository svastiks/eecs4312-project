Functional Requirements
FR1: In its current form, much of the scheduling, monitoring, and user interaction is handled manually or via disconnected systems, limiting efficiency, personalization, and accessibility.
FR2: The management of the center wants to automate and enhance the client experience and operational workflows by implementing a comprehensive smart system.
FR3: The desired system is expected to be accessed both through web and mobile applications, and to integrate with a network of connected devices (IoT), service management dashboards, and backend data analytics.
FR4: The proposed solution should offer clients the ability to create personal accounts, define their wellness goals, and receive tailored recommendations based on their preferences and health profiles.
FR5: The system will also support personalized scheduling and booking of services including workout sessions, consultations, and spa treatments.
FR6: Trainers, doctors, and nutritionists will be able to manage their availability, communicate with clients, and monitor attendance through a unified interface.
FR7: A central component of the system involves the deployment of sensors and smart devices throughout the facility to monitor gym equipment usage, detect maintenance needs, track room occupancy, and manage environmental conditions such as temperature and air quality.
FR8: This integration aims to improve safety, optimize space utilization, and ensure high service availability.
FR9: Additionally, users will be able to connect wearable health devices (such as fitness trackers or smartwatches) to the system, allowing for real-time data collection and personalized health tracking.
FR10: The platform will analyze this data to alert users to potential issues (e.g., elevated heart rate during workouts) and provide wellness insights.
FR11: Payment for services and subscriptions will be facilitated through both traditional and digital methods, including credit/debit cards, digital wallets, and insurance-backed payments (direct billing).
FR12: The system will generate invoices automatically, handle recurring memberships, and provide financial reporting for the administration.
FR13: Clients will receive notifications and alerts related to their upcoming bookings, health tips, and facility announcements, ensuring that they remain engaged and informed.
FR14: Beyond client-centered features, the platform will also support the management through advanced data analytics by enabling the generation of personalized fitness and health reports, performance tracking of staff, peak usage periods, and monitoring of facility revenues and costs.
FR15: Clients will be encouraged to leave feedback on services, equipment, and personnel, and management will have the ability to respond, using this information to drive service improvements.
FR16: Given the sensitivity of health data, the platform must comply with regulatory standards such as HIPAA or GDPR, depending on the jurisdiction.
FR17: Security measures will include multi-factor authentication, rolebased access controls, data encryption, and activity logging.
FR18: The facility will also require high availability and fault tolerance, ensuring uninterrupted service through reliable internet connectivity and appropriate contingency planning.
FR19: The system will be built using a cloud-based backend, providing scalable infrastructure to support growing data and user demands.
FR20: The frontend will be developed to support both web and mobile platforms, ensuring broad accessibility.
FR21: Integration with third-party APIs—for wearables, payment systems, and insurance providers—will be essential to creating a seamless user experience.
FR22: IoT components installed in the facility will communicate over a secure local network with periodic synchronization to the cloud for analysis and reporting.
